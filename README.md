Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (EJS as the view engine)

Backend: Node.js, Express.js

Database: MongoDB (with Mongoose.js ODM)

Tools: Express Generator, VS Code, Git

📄 Project Description:
This project is a full-stack clone of Pinterest, the popular image-sharing platform. It allows users to upload, view, and explore images (pins) in a clean, grid-based layout similar to the original Pinterest interface.

The application uses Express Generator for structured scaffolding and EJS for rendering dynamic web pages. Users can add new pins by uploading image URLs along with titles and descriptions. These pins are stored in a MongoDB database using Mongoose.js, ensuring fast data access and easy schema management.

Key features include:

🖼️ Image Upload (Pin Creation)

🔍 Browse Pins in Masonry Layout

💾 MongoDB Integration for Data Persistence

⚙️ Express.js-based Routing

🎨 EJS Templates for Dynamic Views

🚀 Responsive Design with CSS and JavaScript

💡 Learning Outcomes:
Gained hands-on experience in RESTful API development.

Understood MongoDB CRUD operations using Mongoose.

Learned how to use Express Generator for quick app setup.

Improved knowledge of template engines and full-stack architecture.
